      "If you want my true honest opinion, life is meaningless and nothing you do will ever stop those feelings of existential loneliness, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't live the life you have now to the fullest. The chances of you being born are astronomically low, so there's no point in wasting it on nothing.",

It's very easy to take this for granted because it isn't something we can lose, and it's something everyone has; however, it is an amazing thing. It is the most useful tool in the universe, and we all possess it. Take control of your mind. We like to live in what I call the operating system of our brain, the part of the brain that acts like Google Chrome. It's the mindset of giving in to what it's told to do. You feel anxious and depressed; you might hide and withdraw, you might have cravings and want to indulge. I like to use the mindset of the operator, the operator is the mindset that you can control every single input received by the operating system. The operator oversees all functions of your mind and knows the best thing to do. The operator is highly rational and is not controlled by any other input. The operator is not affected; it only affects.",

      "You do have the 'want' of doing the hobbies you personally like; you just lack the initial motivation to jump-start you... and the money too, sorta lol. I see you enjoy some similar hobbies to me; I too can't cook fully yet, but I do find that sort of fun in cooking in Minecraft or playing some good cooking games like the Papa Louie series. Gardening isn't expensive if you just start off with potted plants, you can take cherry tomatoes, peppers, or just about anything (cactuses too) and see how you prefer that.",
      "Try as many hobbies as you can; that way you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find which one fits you the best. It took me forever to find my hobby that is acrylic Pour Paintings, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my jam. Do what makes you happy and fills your void. Good luck!!",
      "Feeling lost in life and desiring happiness is a common experience that many people go through at different points in their lives. It can be challenging and overwhelming, but it's important to remember that you're not alone in these feelings. It's okay to ask for help and support as you work towards rediscovering happiness. You deserve to live a fulfilling and meaningful life, and with time, self-reflection, and support, you can find your way back to happiness again.",
      "Exercise regularly. Learn about it or hire a personal trainer. Be consistent. It will fill up your free time, make you feel and look better, and put you around other people. Join a group fitness thing, like a spin class or pilates. It helps you get out of the house and get motivated.",
